# 7eblog_frontend

## Introduction

- Web front-end of a micro-blogging system, [Backend here](https://github.com/Zomby7e/7eblog_backend).
- Two article types (readings and notes)
  - The "readings" can be a timeline of news, or you can write down your thoughts while reading, or it can be a diary.
  - "Notes" maybe store teaching, study notes, user manuals, etc.
- Parsing pure markdown content by this front end.
- Save markdown file directly through the front end.
- Hashtags for articles.
- This project uses Vue3 + TypeScript, to run it just execute `yarn serve`, the full reference is at the end of this document.
- If you have suggestions or just want to chat, please see the contact information on my github personal page.
